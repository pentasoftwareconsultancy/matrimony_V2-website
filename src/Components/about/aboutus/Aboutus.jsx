          Round the Room events are currently offered to people in Delhi/NCR,
          Mumbai, and Bangalore. Each of our bespoke Round the Room events has
          handpicked attendees who make it to the event by invite only. This is
          to ensure that at least the odds are in your favor, giving you a great
          chance to hold a conversation and eventually vibe with someone whose
          nuttiness matches your own.
